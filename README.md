# GUVI Webinar

This repo contains materials that I used for GUVI webinar about the topic `Data Science Lifecycle - Introduction`.

## Business Problem
A telecommunication company is facing dip in revenue due to customer attrition and was looking for ways to tackle the issue.

- Analysis of the current churn data and look for patterns
- Possible churn prediction system
- Why solve using data science?
- Not all problems needs to be solved using ML/DL techniques!

### Justification in this use case:

Customer churn does not happen with specific set of factors. Factors may overlap or there many too many resons for the churn.

Scalability: As the organization gets more customers having ML solutions to handle them will be lot better than doing manual analysis.

With these justifications, lets get our customers data and understand.

### Advantages of having a churn prediction system
Client can react in time and retain the customers by making a special offer according to the preference
